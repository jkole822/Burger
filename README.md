## Description

This web application enables users to save the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Each logged burger will be displayed in a list named 'Burgers' on the left side of the screen alongside a "Devour" button. When "Devour" is clicked, the burger is shifted over to a list on the right side of the screen named "Devoured". Additionally, a clear button is available to give the user the option of clearing out the "Devoured" list if they so choose.
